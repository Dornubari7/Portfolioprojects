COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Overview

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of COVID-19, leveraging SQL to extract meaningful insights from pandemic-related data. The analysis focuses on key numerical metrics, regional trends, and vaccination statistics, culminating in a structured view that can be used for visualization in Tableau.

Objectives

Understand the impact of COVID-19 by analyzing key metrics such as total deaths, total cases, and population data.

Identify patterns across different regions and track pandemic progression.

Assess vaccination efforts worldwide using cumulative data

Prepare data for visualization by creating a structured SQL view.

Key Insights

Mortality and Infection Rates

Calculated total deaths over total cases to determine fatality rates.

Analyzed total deaths over total population to assess regional impact.

Regional Trends

Examined country-specific and regional COVID-19 statistics.

Compared infection and mortality rates across different locations.

Vaccination Progress

Computed a running total of vaccinations administered across various regions.

Evaluated the effectiveness and reach of vaccine distribution.

Data Preparation for Visualization

Created a SQL view consolidating critical metrics for seamless integration into Tableau.

Tools Used

SQL: Data extraction, transformation, and analysis.

Tableau: Data visualization and dashboard creation (planned for future use).

Conclusion

This project highlights the power of data analytics in understanding global health crises. By analyzing COVID-19 trends through structured SQL queries, we gain valuable insights into the pandemic's impact, recovery efforts, and vaccination progress. The prepared dataset is now optimized for visualization, offering a clearer perspective on one of the most significant global events in modern history.

Next Steps


Develop interactive Tableau dashboards to visually represent key findings.

Expand the dataset with more recent COVID-19 statistics for continuous monitoring.

Apply advanced analytical techniques to uncover deeper insights into pandemic trends.
